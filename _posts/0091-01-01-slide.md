# Learned things anyway

I ended up learning a lot about deployment as a result of my choice.

Had I chosen another tool, I may have solved the issue of annoying deployment.

But I also would have learned a _different_ lesson
about the drawbacks of _that_ tool.

Agonizing over whether I should use react-boilerplate or create-react-app or
some other tool ended up not mattering in the end.
