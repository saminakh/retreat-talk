# Drawbacks

Create-react-app was sass-unfriendly. Minor quality-of-life/convenience
  thing, but nothing too big.

It is also limited in its build and deployment scripts.

You also can't easily load different `.env`s. From
[dotenv's](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) explanation:

>> No. We strongly recommend against having a "main" .env file and an "environment" .env file like .env.test. Your config should vary between deploys, and you should not be sharing values between environments.

## Takeway: That's just like, your opinion man.
