# retreat-talk

Here you'll find samina using her retreat lightning talk as an excuse to derp
around in jekyll and brush up on her vim skills. :heart:

## Setup

- install [jekyll](jekyllrb.com)
- `jekyll serve` for development (at http://localhost:4000 by default)
- `jekyll build` to build for production
